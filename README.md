# Wieniawski

Experimental refactor of [Mozart](https://github.com/aashrafh/Mozart) optical music recognition models.

### Training data

- [google drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18YngVnanqM26qJwm8HrrDwqMK3KLSGPV/view?usp=sharing)
    - Orginal dataset
- [kaggle](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18YngVnanqM26qJwm8HrrDwqMK3KLSGPV/view?usp=sharing)
    - slightly modifed for kaggle compatablity


### Goals 
1. To understand how this model works
2. To integrate the models with a mobile application that overlays the proper finger numbers of a stanza violin sheet music.
